# BouncingBall

This is a partial C# class named `Form1` within the `BouncingBall` namespace. It represents a Windows Form application that animates a bouncing ball within a rectangular area. The class has several private fields for the dimensions and position of the ball, the movement steps, the rectangular area, and the selected color. There are also two methods: `PaintCircle` and `MoveBall`.

The `PaintCircle` method is called every time the form is redrawn, and it uses the `PaintEventArgs` argument to draw the ball and the rectangular area on the form. The `MoveBall` method is called every time a timer ticks, and it updates the position of the ball based on its movement steps and bounces the ball off the edges of the rectangular area when it reaches them. The `culoareToolStripMenuItem_Click` method handles the click event of a menu item to display a color dialog and set the selected color field to the user's choice.

Overall, this class provides a simple and interactive animation of a bouncing ball, with the ability to change the color of the ball dynamically.
